* Supports all datatypes and asynchronous notifications from the device
* Built with asynchronous scenarios and graphical interfaces in mind
* Intended to be thread-safe **(testing needed!)**
* Communication over UART, TCP and UDP transports
* Proxy functionality - create bridge to another Compost remote
* Simple and flexible API to implement more transports
