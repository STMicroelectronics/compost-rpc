# Compost

Compost is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol generator with a simple wire
format.

It abstracts communication between a PC and an MCU. Basically it allows you to
call functions on your MCU from a PC.

Compost is meant to be used over any medium, but it's simplicity is best suited
for UART/RS232 or UDP/IP.
